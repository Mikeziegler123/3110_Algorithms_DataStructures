It is a major structure in C++ called a Binary Search tree. The program more or less takes in any set of data from a file/s (in this case, containing words(strings), but it could be just about anything with minor changes), allocates memory space for it, and stores the data in an organized way(in this case alphabetically in the form of a tree / \ ). This allows the user to access elements & analysis of the the input data by just filling a text file with 'Queries', which tells the program exactly what to access, and what the user would like to know about those accessed elements. Any elements(or entire files) can also be added, deleted, appended/edited through the structure, and the program creates and keeps track of all of that until it's closed out.

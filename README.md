𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝟭: A C++ program using a Dynamic Array to read in a list of numbers from file "nums.txt".

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝟮: A C++ program that Dynamically allocates gasoline pump('GasPump') class objects, maintaining a running total of the amount of fuel dispensed, and revenues collected. Driver Program simulates fuel demand for a number of vehicles.

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝟯: A C++ program exploring a practical experience with characteristics, and implementation details of inheritance and polymorphism. 
       -Parent    Class  : 'ship'
       -Inherited Class 1: 'CargoShip'
       -Inherited Class 2: 'CruiseShip' 
       
𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝟰: A C++ program to simulate a simple card game between two players. A standard 52 card deck is implimented by the card class, and 
used to play out turns by the player class, and print the games turns/intermediate outcomes, and results.

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝟱: A C++ program that, given a starting point, finds its way out of a maze, using recursive calls, and backtracking. Not by 
looking ahead.

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝟲: A C++ program that reads input from a file "𝗶𝗻𝗽𝘂𝘁.𝘁𝘅𝘁", and builds a binary search tree from the input data. Each of the words of the data set are stored among the tree, and are able to be queried for both: (𝟭)number of occurances of a particular word, and (𝟮)words that mmeet or exceed a specifies threshold of occurances within the input file.

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝟳: A C++ program using a Priority_Queue Class implimented as a binary heap which receives two parameters:
        1) The type of the element stored in the heap. 
 	  	  2) A comparator class type.

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝟴: A C++ program that invokes the use of Dijkstra's Algorithm['DijkstraPaths()'], with the starting vertex read from the file.
